## Are you an Architect?

- Arch is loyal, no matter if project is out of funds, worn under pressure, find a way to fix anything, motivate the team. Programmer are not loyal; they've many jobs, and he can move to another job just for money.
- Arch is disciplined; Design patterns, quality of code, Static analysis, unit testing, high performance, reliability, security and maintainability. Even though, an Arch know that he can find all of these characteristics in programmers.
- Process comes first, people next.

- Arch puts discipline on top of everything else, constantly inventing new rules and enforcing them. Example: Not just making the other to obey also making himself obey them. No changes without a code review...Every idea start with a ticket...The master brach si read only....Static analysis is mandatory....No singletons, no getters/setters....Unit Testing is mandatory for all new changes...No 'informal discussions' outside of tickets...Rules first, architecture second.

- He is strong. Strong supervision from the software architect, projects and attempted solutions tend to fall apart due to the weight on unmitigated complexity.
	Not likely: An ability to stay in the office two days straight with just pizza, and cola? An ability to multiply six-digit numbers in memory? An ability to memorize the purpose and design of all classes and methods? An ability to stay in a meeting with investors for three hours without checking Facebook even once? 
   	Likely: "No, I will not merge your pull request"..."No, we will not implement this feature"..."No, you do not deserve a promotion yet"..."No, your code is not as good as we expect"..."No, this build is not stable enough to be released"..."No, you will not go on vacation this month".

- Regrettably, been an Arch is to be the bad guy. This is what his job is, to be strong, to handle it all calmly and continue leading the project forward, toward his own well-defines tech goals.
- He is Abstract...Programmer think on their own isolated tasks, an Arch think globally and see the product as a whole.


- The key quality if the architect is the ability to work with people: recruit, motivate, and control their results. Social skills helps to accomplish this. High visibility in social networks; a long list of previous projects and teams; active membership in professional groups; publicity in the blogosphere.

- He should say: "It's my fault". If an Arch don't say this, it is just a programmer with a big responsibility who is afraid of it and authority. "Success is your...faults are mine.".

- It's important to make ideas clearly and explain anything in simple words.

- "Understanding code means the architect can use his or her judgment more effectively rather than rely on which developer is more persuasive". Indeed, an architect that is only capable of talking and drawing is a weak architect that will sooner or later let the team and the project down.

- How much code the architect has to write? depends on the age of the project. When the project is young and is still in the phase of prototyping, the architect produces the majority of code. Then, later, when the product matures, the architect steps away and mostly reviews the contribution of programmers. Eventually, when th eproject migrates into the maintenance phase, the architect may quit the project and transfer his responsibilities to one of the programmers.

-  "I want to architect this" That would be the voice of a programmer, not an architect. An Architect wants to be a man of power, not just a smart technical engineer. So, it's way more about a title for him, rather that just his actual responsibilities.
