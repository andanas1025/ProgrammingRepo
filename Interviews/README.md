## Tell me about yourself
Sure! I’m --, an Android Developer with over 10 years of experience. I’ve worked on different industries like retail, travel, and entertainment, building scalable and high-quality apps.

Some highlights from my career: <br>
I helped improve the Disney Cruise Line app, making it easier for guests to plan their activities onboard. <br>
At Rappi, I worked on performance improvements that made the app faster for thousands of users.<br>
Recently, I’ve been leading technical efforts at Globant for clients like Walmart and REI—migrating code from Java to Kotlin, reducing bugs, improving load times, mentoring developers, developing features and creating the design system layer.<br>

I’m passionate about clean architecture, best practices, and helping teams grow. I’m excited about opportunities like this at Disney, where I can contribute to building amazing user experiences."

I'm a Senior Android Engineer with strong experience building scalable and high-impact mobile apps, especially using Clean Architecture, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Firebase. I’ve led mobile projects in both startups and larger companies across Latin America and the U.S., often working under staff augmentation models. 

One of my key achievements was at Rappi, where I contributed to increasing the GMV through improvements in the mobile experience. I'm passionate about code quality, performance, and team collaboration. Lately, I've also been working on an inventory management app using Firestore and modern Android practices. I'm looking for a role where I can combine hands-on development with leadership, and help deliver real value through mobile technology.

## Challenges
Scaling a Mobile App for a Large User Base
<br> In a project I worked on, we had to scale an existing mobile app that was experiencing rapid growth. Initially, the app was designed to handle a small user base, but as we added more features and users, we started facing significant performance bottlenecks.

Managing Increasing Data Volume (pagination and lazy loading)
<br>Performance Optimization (ConstraintLayout and JobScheduler)
<br>Concurrency and Multi-threading Issues (coroutines and RxJava)

**How have you scaled a system or architecture?**
In one of my previous roles, I led the architectural redesign of a monolithic Android application used by millions of users. We transitioned to a modular, clean architecture using MVVM and modern Jetpack libraries.
<br><br>
**Have you led technology migrations?**
Yes — I’ve led several migrations, both frontend and backend. One notable project was migrating an Android app from legacy Java code to Kotlin with a clean architecture, while also introducing modern libraries like Coroutines and Hilt. This migration was done incrementally to minimize risk, with CI/CD automation and extensive test coverage to ensure stability.
<br><br>
**How do you ensure quality, maintainability, and performance?**
I advocate for solid engineering practices like clean architecture, SOLID principles, code reviews, and unit testing. I encourage teams to adopt static code analysis tools and linters to maintain code quality. For performance, I use profiling tools (like Android Profiler or Firebase Performance Monitoring) to catch bottlenecks early. I also push for documentation and technical debt tracking, and I work closely with QA and product to define clear acceptance criteria and test strategies — including automated UI tests and performance regression benchmarks.
<br><br>
**How do you promote technical innovation in your team?**
I create a culture where experimentation is encouraged — for example, through innovation sprints. I stay current with industry trends and share findings regularly with the team, encouraging tech talks and proof of concept initiatives. I also support engineers in attending conferences, contributing to open source, and mentoring others. Innovation often comes from solving real problems, so I empower the team to explore new tools or approaches that can improve our delivery or product experience.

## How have you optimized processes, automated flows, or reduced technical debt?
In a previous role, I led several initiatives focused on improving developer efficiency and product stability:

**Process Optimization:**
I streamlined our mobile release cycle by implementing a branching strategy (GitFlow) and introducing standardized pull request templates and code review guidelines. This reduced merge conflicts and improved code quality across teams.

**Automation of Flows:**
I introduced CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Bitrise for our Android app. This automated build verification, linting, unit tests, and deployment to internal testers via Firebase App Distribution. It cut our manual QA effort by over 40% and enabled faster, safer releases.

**Technical Debt Reduction:**
We inherited a large legacy codebase with inconsistent architecture. I introduced a gradual refactoring strategy, starting with modularizing the app and migrating critical features from MVP to MVVM with clean architecture. Alongside that, we enforced static analysis tools like Detekt and Ktlint to maintain consistency. Over time, crash rates dropped and onboarding new developers became faster and more predictable.

## Apologize to join late
Hey [Name], I’m really sorry I missed our last call. Something unexpected came up, and I wasn’t able to join in time. I value our conversations and would love to reschedule whenever it works best for you.
