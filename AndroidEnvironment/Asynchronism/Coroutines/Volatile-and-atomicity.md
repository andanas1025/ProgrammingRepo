## Volatile 

 Volatile annotation in Kotlin?

In multi-threaded programming, where multiple threads work on shared data, things can get messy. One common problem is when one thread changes a variable, but another thread doesn't immediately notice the update. This can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. The volatile annotation is like a superhero that comes to the rescue.
So, what does volatile do? Two things:

🔹**Ensuring Visibility:**
When you mark a variable as volatile, it guarantees that changes made by one thread are instantly visible to all other threads. 

🔹**Enabling Atomicity:**
Atomicity means that an operation on a variable happens in one step, without any interruptions. With volatile, both reading and writing to a variable become atomic. 

**❖ Example:**
```
@Volatile
private var flag: Boolean = false
fun toggleFlag() {
  flag = !flag
}
fun performAction() {
  if (flag) {
    // Code execution when the flag is true
  } else {
    // Code execution when the flag is false
  }
}
```
In this code, flag is declared as volatile. Multiple threads can call toggleFlag() to change its value, and performAction() uses the flag to decide which code path to take. With volatile, we ensure that any updates made by one thread are instantly seen by others. It's like using a special megaphone that ensures everyone hears the latest message.

Using the volatile annotation in Kotlin is like having a reliable communication system for your threads. It ensures that changes to shared variables are seen by all threads, avoiding confusion and bugs. It also guarantees that operations on the variable happen seamlessly without any interruptions.
