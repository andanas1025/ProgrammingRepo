## Tell me about yourself
Sure! I’m Andrés Rubiano, an Android Developer with over 10 years of experience. I’ve worked on different industries like retail, travel, and entertainment, building scalable and high-quality apps.

Some highlights from my career: <br>
I helped improve the Disney Cruise Line app, making it easier for guests to plan their activities onboard. <br>
At Rappi, I worked on performance improvements that made the app faster for thousands of users.<br>
Recently, I’ve been leading technical efforts at Globant for clients like Walmart and REI—migrating code from Java to Kotlin, reducing bugs, improving load times, mentoring developers, developing features and creating the design system layer.<br>

I’m passionate about clean architecture, best practices, and helping teams grow. I’m excited about opportunities like this at Disney, where I can contribute to building amazing user experiences."

## Challenges
Scaling a Mobile App for a Large User Base
<br> In a project I worked on, we had to scale an existing mobile app that was experiencing rapid growth. Initially, the app was designed to handle a small user base, but as we added more features and users, we started facing significant performance bottlenecks.

Managing Increasing Data Volume (pagination and lazy loading)
<br>Performance Optimization (ConstraintLayout and JobScheduler)
<br>Concurrency and Multi-threading Issues (coroutines and RxJava)

## ProGuard, R8
Shrink, optimize, Obfuscate. Reduces APK Size, improve security
<br>I've been used R8 and customized ProGuard rules to avoid issues like reflective class loading or serialization errors, which are common when shrinking code.
